# Style Guide

Just because you can, doesn't mean that you should.

## Strictly follow this formatting.

> Use Doublequotes `""` first, use singlequotes  `''` inside of it.

> Use `tabs` for Spacing.

> When typing comments, only type atleast 79 characters in a line before,
> typing in another one.
